# Startup-to-IPO Glossary 

**What this is:** a comprehensive, practical glossary for a **first-time US startup founder**—from ideation to IPO. It blends product, growth, fundraising, finance, legal, people, and operations. Each entry expands the term, gives a common **abbreviation (if any)**, and includes **examples** where useful.

**How it was compiled:** a synthesis of widely used books and primary sources, including **Venture Deals** (Feld & Mendelson), **The Lean Startup** (Ries), **Zero to One** (Thiel), **Crossing the Chasm** (Moore), **High Growth Handbook** (Gil), **The Hard Thing About Hard Things** (Horowitz), **Secrets of Sand Hill Road** (Kupor), **Measure What Matters** (Doerr), **Blitzscaling** (Hoffman & Yeh), plus YC essays/guides, a16z/First Round Review, Sequoia’s guides, and standard US venture/legal practices.

> Tip: Use this as a working reference. The **slang & jargon** mini-dictionary is at the end.

## Core glossary (from idea to IPO)

1. **Problem–Solution Fit (PSF)** — early evidence that your solution meaningfully addresses a real, repeatable customer problem. *Example:* 10+ customer interviews showing painful, budgeted workflows you can replace.

2. **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** — the smallest product experiment that delivers value and validates assumptions with real users.

## Mini-examples (quick comprehension)

* **SAFE math:** \$1M SAFE @ **\$10M cap** into a **\$20M pre-money** priced round converts at the **cap** (advantage to SAFE holder).
* **LTV\:CAC:** If LTV is \$6,000 and CAC is \$1,500, **LTV\:CAC = 4:1**, likely healthy if payback ≤12 months.
* **Waterfall intuition:** With **1× non-participating** preferred, investors choose **preference OR pro-rata**—whichever pays more.
