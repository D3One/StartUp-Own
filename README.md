## About the Author & Creator

My name is Ivan Piskunov, and I am the founder and main driver of my own high-tech startup.

My journey in IT began as a security systems administrator. Over several years, I advanced to become a lead specialist, and later, Deputy IT Director for cybersecurity. Eventually, my expertise gained recognition not only in Russia but also internationally.

I consciously evolved from a purely technical role: I became a Security Champion (AppSec), then a Product Security Manager, and ultimately, a CISO (Chief Information Security Officer). This experience gave me a deep understanding of how security and technology integrate with business objectives.

The time came to build my own venture. I left employment to fully dedicate myself to launching and growing my own IT startup, focusing on realizing my vision and ideas.

## What is a High-Tech IT Startup?

An IT startup is more than just a small tech company. It is a venture project aimed at rapid scaling and creating an innovative product or service that solves a significant market problem in a new, often technological, way. Its core is a unique technology, platform, or algorithm, around which a business model is built, focused on explosive growth rather than gradual linear profit.

## Why the US Market is a Key Goal for an Ambitious Startup

Launching an IT startup with global ambitions is unthinkable without considering the US market. It is the epicenter of the global technology ecosystem for several key reasons:
*   **Largest User Market:** Access to a multi-million audience with high purchasing power and a habit of using digital products.
*   **Concentration of Big Tech and Talent:** It's home to the headquarters of leading tech giants (FAANG) and concentrates the world's best engineering, product, and management talent.
*   **Developed Investment and Startup Culture:** The world's highest density of venture investors, business angels, and accelerators (like Y Combinator, Techstars) willing to fund bold ideas.
*   **World's Best Accelerators and Networking:** The opportunity to gain investment, world-class mentorship, and connections through accelerator programs in a few months‚Äîconnections that would take years to build independently.

## Typical IT Startup Launch Framework: Key Milestones

While every startup is unique, the path from idea to a scalable business often goes through similar stages:

1.  **Problem-Solution Fit:** Validating the hypothesis about a significant market problem and finding an initial solution (often in the form of an MVP - Minimum Viable Product).
2.  **Forming the Core Team:** Assembling a small but strong team of like-minded individuals with complementary skills (technical co-founder, product, marketing).
3.  **Building the MVP:** Creating a working product prototype with a minimal feature set, sufficient for testing hypotheses and getting initial feedback from early users.
4.  **Seed Funding:** Raising the first investment round (from angels, accelerators, or early venture funds) to finance further development and market entry.
5.  **Product-Market Fit (PMF):** Reaching the state where the product satisfies strong market demand, confirmed by stable growth, user retention, and satisfaction. This is the key milestone every startup seeks.
6.  **Scaling:** Actively growing the team, marketing activities, and market penetration after achieving PMF. At this stage, larger investment rounds are raised (Series A, B, C...).
7.  **Exit:** The strategic goal of a successful startup: an IPO (Initial Public Offering) or an acquisition (being acquired by a larger company).
